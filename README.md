## About  
Codewars is an online platform designed for programmers to improve their coding skills through practice and community engagement. It offers a variety of coding challenges known as "katas," which are available in multiple programming languages. Users can solve these challenges, learn from others' solutions, and contribute to the community by creating their own katas​.

> [!WARNING]
> Spoiler Alert: Solutions to the katas are available, but I encourage you to attempt solving them yourself first before looking at the answers!
